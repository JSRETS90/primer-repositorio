            <h2>The Villarreal Vélez sisters were raised in Monterrey</h2><p>, and all received training on various instruments at an early age. At some point in their childhood, Daniela and Paulina had selected guitar and drums as their primary instruments, respectively. When the youngest of the three, Alejandra, selected bass guitar as her primary instrument at about age 7, the sisters decided to form a rock power trio in 2013.[1][2] They learned to play rock songs, often via the Rock Band video game series, and posted videos of their performances to YouTube.[3] <br>
            In 2014, 12-year-old Paulina was profiled in the women's drumming publication Tom Tom Magazine.[4] The band first gained widespread notice later in 2014 when, at ages 9 through 14,[5] their YouTube video in which they performed Metallica's "Enter Sandman" went viral among rock music fans, eventually earning more than 20 million views.[6][7][8] The video received attention from Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett, who offered particular praise for Paulina, saying, "The drummer kicks maximum ass!"</p>
