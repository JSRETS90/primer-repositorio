My Coding Journey Repository
Overview
Welcome to my coding journey repository! 🚀 As someone who is relatively new to the world of coding, I've decided to document my progress and share it with the community. This repository will serve as a visual timeline of my learning experience, starting with the projects from FreeCodeCamp.

About Me:
I'm Jorge, and I've recently embarked on the exciting journey of learning how to code. I'm passionate about technology and eager to enhance my skills. This repository will not only showcase my evolving coding projects but also provide insights into the challenges I face and the lessons I learn along the way.

Acknowledgments
I want to express my gratitude to the coding community for being an endless source of inspiration and support. Special thanks to FreeCodeCamp for providing a structured learning path.
